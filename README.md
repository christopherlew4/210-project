# CPSC 210 - Personal Project

## project description - plant manager

The application will allow users to manage their indoor plants. It will allow you to add plants to your garden and 
allow you to customize the:
- name of plant
- type of plant
- how often the plant should be watered
- when plant should be repotted

This application can be used by anyone who has plants. This project is of interest to me because I have a **lot** of 
plants that I always forget to water so I've killed a bunch of them that way. Having a little application that would 
remind me when I need to tend to my plants would be very useful.

##phase 4 : task 3
if i had more time, i would probably refactor the code so that the GUI panels dont have a field of their private classes
like i would just say 
ClickListener cl = new ClickListener() in the constructor instead of having the field
other than that i think it looks pretty good idk
